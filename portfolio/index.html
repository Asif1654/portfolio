                <div class="text">Due to the increasing of traffic accidents, there is an urgent need <br>
                    to control and reduce driving mistakes. Driver fatigue or drowsiness is one of these <br> 
                     major mistakes. Many algorithms have been developed to address this issue by detecting <br>
                      fatigue and alerting the driver to this dangerous condition. The major problem of the <br>
                       developed algorithms is their detection accuracy, as well as the time required to detect <br>
                        fatigue status and alert the driver. The accuracy and the time represent a critical condition <br>
                         that affects the reduction of traffic accidents. Several datasets have been used in the <br>
                          development of fatigue or drowsy detection techniques. These data are gathered from the <br>
                           deriverâ€™s brain Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals or from video streaming recordings <br>
                            of the driver behavior.
                        our main approach was to create a mechanism through which we can notify the gaurdian of the <br>
                    driver that he was not in the condition to drive if he is in drowsiness state and update his <br>
                condition via a message.</div>
